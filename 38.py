#Check if Array Owns its Data

# copies owns the data,
# and views does not own the data,
# but how can we check this?----using base
# base that returns None if the array owns the data.
#Otherwise, the base  attribute refers to the original object.

#Print the value of the base attribute to check if an array owns it's data or not ?

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
x = arr.copy()
y = arr.view()

print(x.base)
print(y.base)

#The copy returns None.
#The view returns the original array.
