#Higher Dimensional Arrays

#An array can have any number of dimensions.

#When the array is created,
# you can define the number of dimensions by using the "ndmin" argument.


# Create an array with 5 dimensions and verify that it has 5 dimensions ?

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], ndmin=5)

print(arr)
print('number of dimensions :', arr.ndim)
