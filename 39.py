#NumPy Array Shape

#Shape of an Array
#The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension.


#NumPy arrays have an attribute called shape that returns
# a tuple with each index having the number of corresponding elements.


# Print the shape of a 2-D array ?

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])

print(arr.shape)
#The example above returns (2, 4), which means that the array has 2 dimensions,
# where the first dimension has 2 elements and the second has 4.
