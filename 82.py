#Creating Filter Directly From Array

#We can directly substitute the array instead
# of the iterable variable in our condition and
# it will work just as we expect it to.


#Create a filter array that will return only values higher than 42 ?

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([41, 42, 43, 44])

filter_arr = arr > 42

newarr = arr[filter_arr]

print(filter_arr)
print(newarr)
