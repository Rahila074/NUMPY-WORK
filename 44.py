#Unknown Dimension

#You are allowed to have one "unknown" dimension.
#Meaning that you do not have to specify an exact number
# for one of the dimensions in the reshape method.
# Pass -1 as the value, and NumPy will calculate this number for you.

#Convert 1D array with 8 elements to 3D array with 2x2 elements ?

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])

newarr = arr.reshape(2, 2, -1)

print(newarr)

#Note: We can not pass -1 to more than one dimension.
