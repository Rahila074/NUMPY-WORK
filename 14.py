#Access 2-D Arrays

#To access elements from 2-D arrays we can use
# comma separated integers representing the dimension
# and the index of the element.

#Think of 2-D arrays like a table with rows and columns,
# where the dimension represents the row and the index represents the column.


#Access the element on the first row, second column ?

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])

print('2nd element on 1st row: ', arr[0, 1])  #row index number,element index number
