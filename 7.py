#2-D Arrays

#An array that has 1-D arrays as its elements is called a 2-D array.

#These are often used to represent matrix or 2nd order tensors.


# Create a 2-D array containing two arrays with the values 1,2,3 and 4,5,6 ?

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print(arr)
